                <p>
                    CADwCODE is a developer website, with tutorials on development languages such as 
                    Visual Basic for Application (VBA), and C#. Basically, this website is a place where 
                    I put all my CAD Macros &#38; its API related knowledge for public share.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is for any working professionals who want to learn VBA/macro programming 
                    to automate their regular repeated work, college going students who want to enhance 
                    their CAD knowledge base and to some extent CAD Software Developers who wants 
                    to learn some knowledge upon CAD Development. Hence, this website is for those people 
                    who want to learn VBA macros &#38; if interested creating Add-ins for those CAD tools 
                    from scratch with no programming knowledge. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Since by education I am not a computer programmer and I don’t know about “Article writing”, 
                    hence all article written here used languages from different material such as <strong>SOLIDWORKS API HELP</strong>
                    and other programming materials. Hope you ignore any typo &#38; grammatical errors and learn from the website.

                <p>
                    I have been working with CAD software from few years predominantly with SOLIDWORKS &#38; 
                    sometimes AUTODESK INVENTOR. Few years ago, while in pursuit of doing my work better, 
                    more specifically faster, I turned towards CODE part of CAD software which is VBA Macros. 
                    In very 1st week I found that it is very difficult for me to write VBA Macros. 
                    So, I seek help from Software Developer friend to help me out. With working with him I 
                    thought why don’t I learn these skills and do macros related work to cater my need since 
                    I cannot rely always on friends for these sorts of work. Hence, I started learning and 
                    working VBA Macros. After learning VBA, I taught VBA programming to my colleague and he 
                    liked very much. While doing some Add-in related projects I worked on Excel programming. 
                    Since I enjoy programming of SOLIDWORKS &#38; MS Excel I thought why don’t share my knowledge to everyone. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I learn all the things on my own and while learning I found that it is very difficult to 
                    learn these things from internet. It required lots of <strong>Goggling</strong> hence I came up 
                    with this website where I can put what I know in a categorized manner. So, I just want to reduce 
                    the effort taken while learning these skills. 
                </p>
