                    In quest of better and fast processing of work, 
                    we think if we can automate our work. Then the problem comes of how to do the automation of work. 
                    If someone is not familiar with any programming languages like Visual Basic or C#, 
                    which is generally a common case, then this task feels very overwhelming 
                    and very soon most persons left their enthusiasm when they face any challenge.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    One of the many reasons for negative reaction is that 
                    there arenâ€™t very much help we get while studying or exploring the programming aspect. 
                    We all gone through this stage and it is very frustrating for us because 
                    there are no free tutorial available over internet similar to other software and programming languages.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Because of this very reason, this website exists. 
                    In this website, I will try to help you to learn programming language for 
                    your CAD software so that you can get confidence in creating macros on your own. 
                    Since I am working on SOLIDWORK software so for start I will provide tutorials for SOLIDWORKS but
                    in future I will provide macro tutorials for other CAD software also. 
                    I will help you in understanding in programming concepts but 
                    I can assume that you are well versed with any SOLIDWORKS software. 
                    In case, you are not then it is highly recommend that please Google any free tutorial for it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are a total beginner in creating macro then please start with VBA Tutorials. 
                </p>

                    This contains:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tutorial on Visual Basic programming language </li>
                    <li>Tutorial on how to use Visual Basic Editor efficiently</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p> 
                    Tutorials on Visual Basic Editor especially helpful to 
                    maximize your scope of programming because the tools provided
                    by the editors for debugging is generally under estimated in case of Visual Basic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you already have knowledge of Visual Basic programming and created macros before, 
                    still I want you to take a glance at VBA tutorials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because there you can maximize the knowledge of VBA language and understand more about to language. 
                    Remember this is the same language used in different Microsoft technologies 
                    and application which we used in our daily life. For example, MS Word, on 
                    which draft of this website is prepared. MS Excel, which we used daily for our official purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are proficient in VBA programming language, 
                    but did not know about SOLIDWORKS objects and then start with SOLIDWORKS Tutorials. 
                    It provides you information about SOLIDWORKS object related to sketch module, part module, 
                    assembly module and other objects of SOLIDWORKS.
                </p>
                <p>Hope you will learn something from here!</p>
